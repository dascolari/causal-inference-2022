Table 1 shows per person incarceration days for each racial group in 2002. Mixed race is omitted from the analysis due to limited sample size. The table shows that for each racial group, males spend more days incarcerated per individual than females. However, the increase in incarceration time for males compared to females is several times larger for black males than other other race.

This fact is highlighted by Figure 1, which shows the male to female ratio of days incarcerated for the three racial groups of interest. We see again that black males spent nearly 30 days incarcerated for every 1 day a black female spent incarcerated.
